With the rise in equity crowdfunding, services such as KYC/AML checks are a necessity for regulated investment activities. North Capital's Direct Invest button can be used with the IgnitionDeck External Purchase Page functionality to provide secure access to their TransactAPI to complete those checks and provide escrow services for your equity/real estate investment needs.

Heads up!

The External Purchase Page functionality is only available via the site's admin and not through the front end project creation form

## How to get started

### Next steps: Progress on a Project

Upon confirming their level of support on the project, investors will be taken to the NorthCapital site to complete the KYC/AML requirements and submit their financial information.

Confirmation of a successful investment will appear within the Transact API dashboard.

Successful investment pledges can then be reported on the project using the IgnitionDeck » IDCF Orders » Add Order process. For more information on manually adding orders to a project, see the Project Progress documentation.
