# 500 Framework—the 500 Parent Theme

[](javascript:window.print())
The Theme 500 Framework is a basic, developer-ready wireframe theme for IgnitionDeck single or multi-project websites. The Theme 500 Framework is intended for use with an IgnitionDeck child-theme, or you can learn how to build your own WordPress child theme.

## Installation

Theme 500 is automatically installed upon the installation and activation of the IgnitionDeck Framework plugin. You can also download the 500 Framework from your dashboard and install via the WordPress themes menu.

Using IgnitionDeck with 500 Framework is extremely simple. You don’t have to touch the shortcodes for your project pages and checkout pages. Simply leave the Project URL and the Checkout URL set to ‘current project page’, and 500 Framework will take care of them for you.

#### Home Page Settings

In order to use the default home page functionality to display a project grid, you’ll need to visit your WordPress admin Settings->Reading menu and select “Your Latest Posts” for the Front Page Displays option.
