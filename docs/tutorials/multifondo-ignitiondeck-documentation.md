# Multifondo - IgnitionDeck Documentation

# Multifondo

[](javascript:window.print())
The Multifondo theme uses the powerful and popular page builder plugin, Elementor page builder plugin (free or Pro versions) in conjunction with the IgnitionDeck Crowdfunding plugins. Custom crowdfunding modules, specifically designed to work with the Elementor templates make it simple to design the look and feel of your site and incorporate the IgnitionDeck Crowdfunding functionality, whether for traditional crowdfunding, charitable fundraising, real estate investments, or other equity-raising projects.

#### Good to know

To install this theme you must have a working version of WordPress and the IgnitionDeck Crowdfunding plugins already installed, registered, and set up.

## Installation

### WordPress Upload

### FTP Upload

## Setting Multifondo Homepage with Elementor and IgnitionDeck

## Site Header

Heads up!

The Multifondo theme has an integrated Header that is auto-populated with 1) your site's logo, 2) the navigation items designated as the main menu, and 3) the dynamic IDC Account links.

These are all defined via WP's Appearance Â» Customize interface.

If you choose to create a custom Header through Elementor, these elements will need to be created manually including the dynamic IDC Account links. See Custom User Account Links for further instructions.

## Adding a Projects to the Home Page

The custom IgnitionDeck Crowdfunding module, grid and slider, use the Project Categories to filter and display the site's projects into a grid layout or an animated slider.

Important note: the crowdfunding modules will not appear on the page until there are published projects on the site. The preview and Elementor editor appearance may differ slightly (i.e. projects may not appear aligned initially or fully populated) until the page is published.

# Default IgnitionDeck Pages

Important note: the default pages are rendered with shortcodes (i.e. dashboard [idc_dashboard] and the checkout [idc_checkout] ). These need to be created using the Default template and default WP editor. Elementor will break this functionality.
