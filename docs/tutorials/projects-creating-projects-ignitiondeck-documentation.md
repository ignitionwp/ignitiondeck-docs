# Projects | Creating Projects

[](javascript:window.print())
To create a project via the admin, go to the Projects menu in your WordPress

This is where IgnitionDeck projects are added and where you can also view and update existing IgnitionDeck projects like adding or updating descriptions, prices, levels, images, and campaign dates.

### Add New Project

To add a new project, simply click the “Add New Projects” link in the menu or to the right of the “Projects" title above the list of Projects.

You should see a screen come up that is very similar to the default WordPress "Add New Post" screen with the addition of several IgnitionDeck options defined below.

Skip the default Content field/block area, and head right for the Project options.

### Fill out the required information to make your Project live.

```

Please note: that you can not use shortcodes directly within the Project Form fields.

### External Purchase Pages

It is possible to set each project to use an external payment page such as to a PayPal donation button or other payment / escrow account. When the supporter clicks on the Support Now button or any reward levels provided in the project, they will be directed to the off-site checkout page automatically.

This option is located in the right hand column of the project form on the admin side of the site (not available for front-end project creators with IgnitionDeck Enterprise).

Important note: any transactions that occur on an external checkout using this method will not be reported back to the IgnitionDeck project. To report progress toward the project's goal, the site administrator will need to manually add the orders via IgnitionDeck » IDCF Orders » Add New.
