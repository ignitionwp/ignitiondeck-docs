Google eCommerce Tracking permits you to set up Google Analytics on your site to monitor transactions and page traffic.

Note: if you are using the 500 Framework parent or a 500 child theme, you should deactivate the tracking here and enable the module tracking instead due to the discontinuation of UA by Google. Please see Google's documentation on migrating from UA to GA4 tracking.

For further information on how to use Google Analytics, please refer to the Google Analytics documentation.

Note: the Google eCommerce module currently only tracks Stripe transactions.  PayPal transactions are not tracked.
