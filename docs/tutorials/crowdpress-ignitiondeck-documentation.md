#### Before you Install the CrowdPress Theme

To install this theme you must have a working version of WordPress and the IgnitionDeck Crowdfunding plugins already installed, registered, and set up.

## Installation

Download the CrowdPress Theme from your IgnitionDeck Dashboard.  There are two ways to install a WordPress theme:

WordPress Upload: Navigate to Appearance > Themes > Add New > Upload Theme. Click the Choose File button, select the crowdpress.zip file from your computer and click the Install Now button.  Once the theme package has been uploaded, WordPress will prompt you to activate the theme.

FTP Upload: Unzip the crowdpress.zip package. Using your FTP program, upload the resulting theme folder to your wedsite’s /wp-content/themes/ directory.  Then log into your WordPress Dashboard, navigate to Appearance > Themes and activate CrowdPress.

For more information on using WordPress themes, see WordPress.org’s Documentation.

### Create a Featured Project Type

To make use of CrowdPress’ ‘Staff Picks’ functionality, and the Home Page Flipping Slider, create a Project Type with the slug  ‘featured’ by going to the Projects > Project Types screen. Featured Project Type name and description can be anything you want, as long as the slug is set correctly to ‘featured.’

### Create Your Home Page with Proper Page Layout.

Create your Home Page.  This can be called anything you like, but you should select the “HOMEPAGE” Page Layout in Page Settings, below the main content editing area.

Choose Your Home Page’s Featured Campaigns Style/Text and Number of Campaigns to Display

There are a few other settings in the Page Settings area (below your Home Page’s main content editor) that sould also be configured before moving on.

### Create a Posts/Blog Page, IgnitionDeck Purchase Page, Contact Page and Others.

At this point, it’s a good idea to set up some of the pages you will want to have on your site. Some of these are optional, but will be used in the steps that follow below for building your site’s Navigation Menu(s), and assigning your Home Page to load at your site’s main Web address.

Create the following pages:

NOTE: We recommend using the popular Contact Form 7 Plugin for your form builder, but there are many other options.  For instructions on how to build a contact form with Contact Form 7, see their documentation.

### Set Your Home Page in Settings > Reading

Navigate to Settings > Reading.  In the “Front page displays” section, check the box for “a static page.” For “Front page,” select the page “Home” (created in previous step). For “Posts page,” select “Blog.”

### Create Your Site Navigation Menus in Appearance > Menus and Assign to CrowdPress Menu Locations

CrowdPress has two Menu Locations: Main Menu (top of site) and Footer Menu (bottom of site).  In addition, CrowdPress will automatically detect that IgnitionDeck Commerce (IDC) is running on your site and insert your IDC Account Links (Login/Register/My  Account/ Log out).  For more information on implementing/customizing IDC Account Links see Default Pages and IDC Account Links.

NOTE: WordPress’ Menu Screen does not show all available content/link types by default.  For instance, if you wish to add Project Categories to your menus, you may need to use the Screen Options to un-hide Project Categories from your Menus Screen.

For more information on how to use menus in WordPress, please refer to WordPress.org’s documentation.

### Customize Your CrowdPress Crowdfunding Site

We’ve included a number of options in the Appearance > Theme Options panel of your WordPress installation that will allow you to make your CrowdPress site unique.
