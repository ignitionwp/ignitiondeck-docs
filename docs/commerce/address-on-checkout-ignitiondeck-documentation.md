# Address on Checkout

[](javascript:window.print())
The Checkout Shipping Address module permits the supporter to add their shipping address during the checkout.  Once the module has been activated, it is advisable to also activate the Shipping Address on the supporter’s profile in IDC » CRM Settings so the supporter can update their address themselves after a purchase has been made.

Once the payment gateway has been chosen by the supporter, they will be prompted to enter their shipping address before completing their purchase through the payment gateway.
