# Anonymous Checkout & Comments

[](javascript:window.print())
The Anonymous Donation and Comment module permits the supporter to make their pledge anonymously if they wish.  While a user account is still associated with the supporter for the purpose of providing receipts, their pledge will be displayed on the Project Backer list as “Anonymous”.  The project creator will still be able to export the supporter’s information in case a reward is provided or to send thank you messages.

Once the payment gateway has been chosen by the supporter, they will be prompted to donate anonymously if they wish and enter a comment.  The comment will appear on the Backer list of the project along with the supporter’s name or “Anonymous”.
