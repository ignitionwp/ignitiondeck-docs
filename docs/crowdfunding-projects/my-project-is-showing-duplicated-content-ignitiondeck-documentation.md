# My project is showing duplicated content

[](javascript:window.print())
If you see 2 copies of the project content inside the project page, deactivate the automatic project template insertion in IgnitionDeck » Project Settings.

Good to know!

Normally this is activated automatically on the free version of the plugin if the site is using a non-IgnitionDeck theme.

It is not usually required by the paid version of the plugin; however, theme behavior may require this option to be checked.
