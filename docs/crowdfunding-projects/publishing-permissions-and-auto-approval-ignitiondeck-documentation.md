# Publishing Permissions and Auto-Approval

[](javascript:window.print())
By default, the creator projects are submitted in the "pending" state for administrative curation and approval. Once a project has been approved, the administrator would publish the project, just like a regular WP page or post, and the project will be made live to the public.

This setting is located in Commerce » General tab » Enterprise Settings with a valid paid IgnitionDeck license.

Heads up!

Projects can be set to be approved automatically which will skip the pending/moderation process.

Use this option with CAUTION as it is possible for creators to publish incomplete projects.
