# Optional Features | Password Reset

[](javascript:window.print())

The  Password Reset module allows you to bypass that default WordPress password reset process in order to keep your users on the front-end of your website. This not only keeps the users away from your admin portal, but also helps reinforce the branding of your white label crowdfunding platform or fundraising website.

To use this module, simple visit the IgnitionDeck->Modules menu and activate the module titled  Password Reset.

This will enable a 3 step process:

1. Redirect to the dashboard to display a custom form that asks the user to submit their login email address.

2. Upon submission, they will receive a confirmation email with a reset link that takes them back to the dashboard, where they’ll enter a new secure password.

3. Once submitted, the password will update and the user will be redirected to the login form on the dashboard.
