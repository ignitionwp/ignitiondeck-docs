  Hero unit options
 

Stellar’s homepage Hero Unit can be managed from the 500 settings section either by uploading a static image or using a Slider short code, we recommend (Revolution Slider).

### Slider

### Static Image

### Home Hero Section Widget

## Site Navigation

Stellar supports two navigation locations which are managed through Appearance » Menus:

## Widgetized Home Page Layout

Stellar has 4 widget areas on the default home page provided by the theme: the Home Hero Section Widget, Home Top Content Widgets, Home Content Widgets, and the Top of Footer widget area.

### Home Hero Section Widget option

The Home Hero Section widget can be used to replace the Slider or Static Image (set in Appearance » 500 Settings » Home Feature Options) with more custom options.

For best results use the 500 Content Wide Custom widget with a height of 630px.
