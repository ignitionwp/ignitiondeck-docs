[](javascript:window.print())
Failing to save or re-save your permalink settings after activating the IgnitionDeck plugins will usually result in “404 Page Not Found” errors on your website.

If you have trouble viewing project pages or your purchase form, it is likely that you need to re-save your permalink settings to /%post-name%/ under Settings » Permalinks
