## How to Create ID Commerce Products

### Product Status

The Product Settings have an option for the Product Status.  There are 3 statuses available: Active, Archived, and Disabled.

Active products will be products that are currently in use on live projects and/or projects with pending pre-authorization payments.

Once a project has been completed (closed and any outstanding payments captured), you can set the product to Archived.  This removes the product from the list tidying up your Download settings, and other menus that include products.  This method maintains the history of the product and associated transactions but permits you to clean up the admin menus.

The Disabled product status can be used to temporarily or permanently prevent the purchase of a product from your site.  This may be for a subscription product to your site, a download product, or other content you may offer.  Disabling the product prevents any purchase of the product (i.e. if a user had bookmarked the purchase page for later) once the product has been marked disabled while maintaining the purchase history.  A disabled product can be reactivated by the admin if desired.  Setting a product to disabled also removes the product from the list tidying up your Download settings, and other menus that include products while still maintaining the history of the product and associated transactions.

To view Archived or Disabled products again, click on the Show All link in the Product Settings.  Active products are shown by default.

ID Commerce products work just like any standard membership level would. They control access to content, downloads, and credits, and are purchased individually via ID Commerce checkout.

### How to Edit ID Commerce Products

Editing ID Commerce products is super simple. Just select the level from the drop down, change the values you need to change, and click save. You’re done!

### Controlling Access through Products

ID Commerce products work just like any standard membership level would. They control access to content, downloads, and credits, and are purchased individually via ID Commerce checkout.
