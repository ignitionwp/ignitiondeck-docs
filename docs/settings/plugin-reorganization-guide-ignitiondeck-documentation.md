# Plugin Reorganization Guide

[](javascript:window.print())
IgnitionDeck 2.0.0 comes with a brand new navigation putting all menu items under one main "IgnitionDeck" header. No longer will Projects, IgnitionDeck, and ID Commerce be split out into separate menues!

If you've updated from version 1.x.x, this guide is especially for you to reorient yourself on where things have been moved.

If you are here with version 2.x.x—welcome! This guide will provide you with a summary of where you can find the plug's settings and funcationality.

## 1 Setup

The Setup menu contains the 6 steps for activating the IgnitionDeck Crowdfunding plugin and setting the default values for the site.

## 2 Settings

## 3 Commerce

The Commerce menu contains 4 tabs containing configuration options for General Settings (including CRM and front end ecommerce behaviours), Gateways, the Backer Dashboard, and Emails.

Heads up!

All settings and functionality here requires that the IgnitionDeck Commerce platform is set as the ecommerce platform for the crowdfunding projects. These sections will be disabled if using WooCommerce as the commerce platform for crowdfunding. See WooCommerce & IgnitionDeck

## 4 Projects

The Projects menu contains the interface where projects can be created and/or curated when submitted via the front end project form. The Projects menu has 3 nested menu items available by default, with an additional 2 items if the FAQ & Updates feature is activated under the Settings menu.

## 5 Orders

The Orders menu contains 3 tabs pertaining to the transactions and orders occuring through the payment gateways.

## 6 Products

The Products menu contains 4 tabs for the management of products and their assignment to crowdfunding projects, as well as (optional) associated digital content and purchase upgrade pathways.

## 7 User Linking

The User Linking menu is where you find all user accounts with their associated purchases. This area allows you to manage the user's purchases, content access, and site permissions.

## 8 Troubleshooting

The Troubleshooting menu is where the optional tool to synchronize and fix any discrepencies between Orders and Projects » Progress can be made.
