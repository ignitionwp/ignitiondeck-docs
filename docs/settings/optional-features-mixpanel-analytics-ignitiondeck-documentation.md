# Optional Features | MixPanel Analytics

[](javascript:window.print())
Mixpanel offers custom event tracking and analytics for websites and applications, making it the perfect companion to your current web analytics platform. By default, this extension (requires IgnitionDeck Commerce) tracks every button/link click on the project, payment choice clicks, and purchase form clicks. It also tracks every sale, capturing variables such as price, project name, level name, transaction id, and order status.

### How to Install and Use Mixpanel Analytics.

Be sure to check out Mixpanel’s documentation and Mixpanel University for further information on how you can use Mixpanel.
