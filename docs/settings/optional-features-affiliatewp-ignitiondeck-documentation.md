The AffiliateWP module allows you to integrate the AffiliateWP WordPress plugin into your crowdfunding site and create referrals on crowdfunding projects.

## Use Cases

The AffiliateWP module for IgnitionDeck provides the means to track and reward the sharing of a project by enthusiastic supporters or team members

### Reward Supporters

Not everyone has the means to provide financial backing to a project directly; however, that doesn't mean that those individuals can't have a major impact on a project by sharing to their network of contacts.

Set up AffiliateWP to permit supporters to share a project that they are passionate about using their own unique link.

Rewards could be physical, digital, or simple public acknowledgement towards the project's success.

### Team Members

Fundraising for non-profits, school and sports groups, and other more donation-based activities can often be incentivized by making funding activities a team effort.

AffiliateWP permits the formation of groups or teams on a single project. Members of those groups can then share their unique project links and get credit for their team on conversions.

No extra projects required for each team!

## Integrating IgnitionDeck with AffiliateWP

The majority of the configuration (pretty URLs, optional payments, etc.) is done within the AffiliateWP plugin's settings. Please see their documentation to get started: AffiliateWP.com Â» Getting Started

ðŸ’¡For the convenience of the site users, including a navigation link to the Affiliate dashboard is a good idea. This can be included as a navigation widget in the IgnitionDeck dashboard sidebar (visible to logged in users) or as part of the site-wide navigation (visible to all site visitors).

## Creating Referral URLs for Projects

AffiliateWP makes it easy to set up a referral URL for the project to be shared.
