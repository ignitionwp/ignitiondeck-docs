Multisite is aÂ type of WordPress installation that allows the creation and management of multiple websites from a single WordPress dashboard. This allows for changes and updates to all the websites from one place as they share the same database.

Good to know

The IgnitionDeck license is valid for a single domain OR subdomain (i.e. domain.com, crowdfunding.domain.com, domain.com/en/, etc.) so the planned usage of the plugin must be considered carefully.

## Why use Multisite?

Multisite networks are frequently used by corporations, educational institutions, news outlets, online businesses, and more.

In the crowdfunding environment, a Multisite network could be used for regionalization of projects (i.e. location and/or translation), or for each member group within a larger organization (i.e. individual sports teams under an umbrella organization).

## What are the pros and cons of using Multisite?

Pros
Cons

Central management of plugins and themes

Option A: Network activation of plugins

Option B: Site by site activation of plugins

## IgnitionDeck and Multisite

The IgnitionDeck plugin can be used with Multisite with either method of activation.

### Use Cases for Network Activation

Network Activation with IgnitionDeck is a great option for situations such as localization of projects or languages are required. In this scenario, the plugin would be activated and configured at the network level so that all subsites use the same settings and payment gateways, but the subsite could then be displayed in individual languages, regions, or have a targeted audience.

Heads up!

Projects are unique to the subsite they are published on and can not be linked to be displayed or show progress between each subsites.

### Use Cases for Site-by-Site Activation

Site-by-site activation with IgnitionDeck is a great option that allows for the creation of a white-labeled crowdfunding platform with its own branding without impacting all sites in the network. This is a popular option for an organization that already runs a multisite and wants to add crowdfunding to their existing network.

An example of this scenario would be an educational organization that runs a multisite witih portals for students, alumni, as well as a public face (i.e. school.com, student.school.com, alumni.school.com). A new subsite could be generated with the IgnitionDeck plugin activated on the fundraising.school.com subsite.
