# What is IgnitionDeck

[](javascript:window.print())

## IgnitionDeck serves people who are starting up crowdfunding businesses.

Here are a few examples of the types of people we serve…

## What these people all have in common is that they want to have control over their platforms.

They want control over their brand, data, fees, payment methods, and treasuries.

They want to freely manipulate their product anytime they want, without being trapped by the boundaries imposed on them by a hosted product that a vendor manages with its own priorities.

But they also need it to be affordable. Building and maintaining an entire crowdfunding platform sounds like an expensive challenge, especially for people who aren’t developers with experience launching and operating complex online companies.

## We use WordPress as the structural base for IgnitionDeck to do what it does best.

WordPress includes a ton of foundational functionality out of the box, so you don’t have to reinvent the wheel. Everything from table-stakes features like user account management and custom themes to advanced functionality like content management and a customizable database. It’ll get you started instantly in an open-source environment that you control 100%.

Once your crowdfunding platform is up, you can leverage WordPress’s gigantic plugin ecosystem to create any functionality you can imagine for the rest of your website. The right configuration of plugins can make your site indistinguishable from juggernaut crowdfunding platforms if you desire.

## Getting started on your crowdfunding business couldn’t be easier.

You can learn about the different editions of the IgnitionDeck software from our website to choose which version is right for you.

If you’re already comfortable with WordPress and plan to configure everything yourself, you can get started immediately with the Core license and then follow our Getting Started guide.

Need more help getting launched? Then our Deployed license package is a great option for you.
