IgnitionDeck with ID Commerce makes it easy to build a robust crowdfunding site that will feature a multitude of gateways, email features, content protection, and much more.

### Product to Reward Level connection for Admin created project (free and Core)

Once you have connected your Products to your Reward Levels, you will see lightbox/popover dialogue when clicking to support the project via the site’s front-end.

### Product to Reward Level connection for Front-End Submissions (Core Only)

If using IgnitionDeck Core (paid), projects will be submitted on the front-end with products created and associated automatically. Use the admin settings only when creating products via the admin or when needing to make changes to projects/products that already exist.

An error message such as the following indicates that the project's reward level(s) have not been successfully connected to a product for a transaction to be completed. Review the product creation and product→reward level connections to solve any errors.
