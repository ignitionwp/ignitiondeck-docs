## General Settings

### Automatically insert Project Page (optional)

This should be checked in order for the IgnitionDeck project post template to be used to populate the projects on your site. The project template should, in the majority of cases, be displayed automatically; however, if it is not, check the box here to insert the template

Heads up!

If multiple copies of the project content are appearing inside the project page, deactivate the automatic project template insertion here to eliminate the duplicates.

### Hide Failed Projects (optional)

Hide any projects that have failed to meet the project goal from being displayed the homepage project grid.

Good to know:

### Set Default Checkout Page

A default purchase page must be created for the payment form to be dynamically generated based on the project and reward level being supported. This is normally designated during the initial wizard set up; however, if a new page is needed, it can be set here.

Heads up!

### External Purchase Pages (optional)

It is possible to set each project to use an external payment page such as to a PayPal donation button or other payment / escrow account. When the supporter clicks on the Support Now button or any reward levels provided in the project, they will be directed to the off-site checkout page automatically.

This option is located in the right hand column of the project form on the admin side of the site (not available for front-end project creators with IgnitionDeck Enterprise).

Good to know:

## Optional Features

There are several Optional Features that can be enabled to further customize the behaviour of the crowdfunding site.

Heads up!
