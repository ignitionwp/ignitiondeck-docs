# Funding Type Options

[](javascript:window.print())
IgnitionDeck Enterprise offers five funding type choices for projects submitted via the front-end submission form:

By default, the front-end submission form will use the  immediately deliver funds option, but this can be easily changed via the IgnitionDeck Commerce (IDC) Crowdfunding settings at IDC » Crowdfunding, where you can choose between the funding types available to front-end project creators.

Should you make a mistake or need to change the funding type for a project after it has been submitted, you can do so by going to the main settings screen of IgnitionDeck Commerce and selecting the product from the dropdown menu in Product Settings section.

Note: Since IgnitionDeck Commerce is also an e-commerce solution for selling products outside of a crowdfunding scenario, the terminology for the funding options is slightly different on this screen.
