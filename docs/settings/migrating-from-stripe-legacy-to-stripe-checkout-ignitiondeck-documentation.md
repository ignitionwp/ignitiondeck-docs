# Migrating from Stripe (legacy) to Stripe Checkout

[](javascript:window.print())
Our default Stripe payment gateway (located in IDC Â» Gateways) is going away in favour of the modern, feature rich Stripe Checkout module we introduced in 2020. Making the switch is an easy process!

### To make the switch:

Important notes for Stripe Connect

The Stripe Connect settings will appear in the same settings page as the Stripe Checkout, rather than a separate tab as with the legacy version.

No changes are needed on the Stripe Connect application itself (unless Subscription funding is in use, see below).

### Important notes for Immediate Capture transactions

Follow the steps 1-7 above and you are done!

No changes are needed on the Stripe account itself. All end points and webhooks are the same between the legacy Stripe gateway and Stripe Checkout.

### Important notes for 100% Threshold / All-or-nothing / Pre-order transactions

If you are using the 100% Threshold / pre-authorization funding method, you will need to process any uncaptured pre-authorization tokens in the current gateway before proceeding to make the switch.

Once those transactions have been completed, follow steps 1 through 7, above.

No changes are needed on the Stripe account itself. All end points and webhooks are the same between the legacy Stripe gateway and Stripe Checkout.

### Important notes for Recurring / Subscription transactions

Please contact us before making the transition over to the Stripe Checkout module.

If you are using the Recurring / subscription funding method, any subscriptions that were previously completed through the payment gateway will be unaffected as subsequent scheduled payments are initiated through Stripe.
