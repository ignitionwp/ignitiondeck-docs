## Before you Install the Settlement Theme

To install this theme you must have a working version of WordPress, the IgnitionDeck 500 Framework parent theme, and the IgnitionDeck Crowdfunding plugin already installed, registered, and set up.

### Installation

WordPress Upload: Navigate to Appearance » Themes » Add New » Upload Theme. Click the Choose File button, select the fivehundred-settlement_[version].zip file from your computer and click the Install Now button.  Once the theme package has been uploaded, WordPress will prompt you to activate the theme.

FTP Upload: Unzip the fivehundred-settlement_[version].zip package. Using your FTP program, upload the resulting theme folder to your website’s /wp-content/themes/ directory.  Then log into your WordPress Dashboard, navigate to Appearance » Themes and activate Settlement.

## Home Top Content Section

### Customize Your Hero-Image/Slider

Settlement’s homepage Hero Unit can be set from the Appeance » Widgets using the 500 Content (wide) widget to set a static image with text, or using a shortcode for a slider, we recommend (Revolution Slider).

## Home Content Section

### Project Grid

Add a project grid (or two or three!) to the page using the Project Grid widget in the Home Content area. This can be set to display all projects as they are published or the projects can be filtered according to various criteria, including:

These can be further sorted by ascending or descending values. The number of projects can be set (recommend in multiples of 4) or enter -1 to display all projects limited by the number of "posts" defined in Settings » Reading » Blog pages show at most

### Additional Settlement Widgets

The Settlement theme has additional widgets not offered by any other IgnitionDeck theme. These include:

All other 500 widgets can also be displayed in this area as well as other WP widgets (classical and block editor).

## Top of Footer Section

The Top of Footer section appears directly above the footer and below the Home Content section. It has 4 columns which can accommodate widgets of your choice.

If you wish to put a widget on the far left and far right, leaving the middle two columns empty, you will need to insert a "text" widget into each column with &nbsp; (invisible text) inserted to prevent the columns from collapsing.

## Additional Customizations for the Settlement theme

We’ve included a number of options in the Appearance > Customize panel of your WordPress installation that will allow you to make your Settlement site unique.
