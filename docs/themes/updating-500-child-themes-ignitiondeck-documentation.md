# Updating 500 child themes

[](javascript:window.print())
The child themes do not have an automatic update process. Whenever there is an update to the parent theme, you should also check your https://members.ignitiondeck.com/ account or the child theme's release notes for any available updates to that child theme. Wherever possible, IgnitionDeck will update the parent theme first and foremost, but some changes may be required on the child theme level.

### Obtain the Updated Theme Files

### Updating via the WP Admin

### Updating via FTP
