# Assigning Projects & Products to a New User

[](javascript:window.print())

Good to know

This functionality requires a paid IgnitionDeck license and project creator privileges enabled

Assigning a project and its associated products maybe required where the original creator is not the intended end recipient. This can be accomplished in two parts:

## Assign the Project to a New User

## Assign IDC Products to a New User

Warning

Products must be unique to the project and not products that are associated with multiple projects otherwise conflicts will result.

### Heads up!

The intended user must have already created an account with the necessary creator permissions on the site before assignments of projects and products can be completed.

They should also have payment account(s) connected to receive funds, otherwise all funds will be deposited with the admin account regardless of the project/products assignments to the new user.
