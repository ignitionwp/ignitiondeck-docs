# Upgrade Pathways

[](javascript:window.print())
Once products have been created and prices set, product upgrade pathways can be created. Upgrade pathways permit a supporter to choose a higher level product and pay the difference in price between the new product and that of the previous product they purchased.

### Create a New Pathway

In the above example, a user that purchases the Ruby level can upgrade to Emerald, Sapphire, and/or Diamond and they will pay the difference in price between the two levels.

### Editing Existing Pathways

In the above example, the Ruby product was removed from the upgrade pathways resulting in the only upgradeable products being Emerald, Sapphire, and Diamond.

### Delete Existing Pathways
