# Which Plugin Package is Right for Me?

[](javascript:window.print())
The free version of IgnitionDeck is a great option if you are doing crowdfunding for yourself with offline or PayPal payments.

To expand that functionality, the paid version provides additional payment options for credit cards and cryptocurrencies, integration with MailChimp for newsletters built right in to keep in touch with your supporters via email and share your projects across social networks, and track data on where your visitors are going on your site and where they are coming from to better target your advertising.

The paid IgnitionDeck plugin is a white-labeled product that allows you to create a platform that permits other users to create and manage their own projects. You can set up your payment gateways to collect crowdfunding fees (available with Stripe and CoinPayments) and direct funds to your project creators. The platform supports several different funding options: immediate capture, 100% threshold, and recurring/subscription payment options depending on your payment gateway choice.

* Frontend project form and creator account connections requires the ID Commerce platform; therefore, is not compatible with WooCommerce in that configuration

** Depending on payment gateway support

Interested in having your site managed entirely by IgnitionDeck (hosting, configuration, updates), please book a call with us to discuss your requirements.
