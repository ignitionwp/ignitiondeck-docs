## Assigning Products on Registration

Registered users will appear in the IDC » Members table once there is an IDC Product associated with their account. This most commonly occurs after a successful transaction has been made on a project. However, it may be useful to have all registered users appear in the IDC » Members table upon their registration to the site. To accomplish this, a product needs to be assigned upon registration.
