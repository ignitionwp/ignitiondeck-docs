While User Linking is its own menu within the plugin navigation, it specifically deals with user accounts and products assigned to those users.

There are 3 conditions which will add a product to a user's account:

Note: A user will only appear on the User Linking table if there has been a product assigned to their account if conditions 1 and/or 2 have been completed.

If the manual assignment of products for the purpose of changing user permissons is needed, it is suggested that a "registration" product (condition 2) is used to ensure the user appears on the table.

See How to use Products to Manage Members for more details.
