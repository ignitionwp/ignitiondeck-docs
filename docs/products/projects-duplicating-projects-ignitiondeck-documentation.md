ðŸ’¥New with IgnitionDeck Crowdfunding update v. 2.2.0

Need to create multiple projects with the same content and rewards with only an edit to the title or other small changes?

Well great news! Creating multiple project has never been easier.

You can now copy an existing project, copy a copy of a project, copy a copy of a copy of a project, and so forth!

## Set up the "Original" Project

You will need to have one completely set up project. That includes:

If steps 3 and 4 are not completed on the project to be duplicated, those steps will have to be completed manually for the original and duplicated projects before publishing the projects.

## Create the Duplicate Project

Once your original project has been created, return to the Project list page.

Hover over the project you want to duplicate to see the Duplicate Project hyperlink. Click on it.

A duplicated project will be produced in DRAFT status titled as Project Name (Duplicate). You can now edit that project with any changes required.

  Duplicated Projects
 

The duplicated crowdfunding product will appear in the IDC Â» Product Settings menu as Product Name (Duplicated) with the same price, transaction type, and terms

  Duplicated IDC Products
 

Under IDC Â» Crowdfunding, the Original Project will be connected to the Original product, and the Duplicated Project will be connected to the Duplicated product.

  Original connected to Original, Duplicated connected to Duplicated
 

When viewing the IDC Â» Crowdfunding page, the Reward level title (i.e. "Original PWYW" in the screenshot above) will not have the (duplicate) text added to it.

Once less thing to edit on your draft project before publishing.

## What Duplication Won't Do

Duplication is only available on the admin side of the site.

Project Creators with Enterprise will not be able to duplicate their projects from the front end dashboard.
