On the rare occasion when a miscommunication occurs between the website and the payment processor, the progress of a project may not align with the actual amount collected through the payment gateways. To resolve this inconsistency and synchronize the records with those captured by ID Commerce, there is a troubleshooting feature accessible at Troubleshooting.

The IDC Troubleshooting interface is designed to function exclusively with orders placed through the ID Commerce platform. Any discrepancies in orders using WC will require manual handling.

For step by step instructions, see the Troubleshooting sync guide.
