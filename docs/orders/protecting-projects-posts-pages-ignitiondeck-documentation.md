# Protecting Projects, Posts & Pages

[](javascript:window.print())
With the IgnitionDeck Commerce platform, it is possible to protect content in order to control who can view the project, page, or post.  This functionality is available via the WP admin.

Note: Protecting content can be done with the IgnitionDeck Enterprise suite; however, this functionality is only available for the site admin.

### To Protect a Project

Note: the user does not need to own all of the products selected but any one of the selected products in order to view the protected content.

The same process is applied to protect regular WordPress Pages or Posts, or with the IgnitionDeck Updates & FAQ extension content.
