# Profile Donations

[](javascript:window.print())
Note: This module is for the IgnitionDeck Enterprise plugin suite only.

Requirement: Payment gateways must be enabled for creators in order for funds to be sent to the recipient project creator.

The Profile Donation adds a donate button onto the Project Creator’s profile permitting visitors to make donations to the project creator outside of their active projects.  The Creator Profile page can be accessed to clicking on either the project creator’s Name or Published Projects links in the Author area of the project (link availability may vary by theme).

The donate button will appear as part of the profile and will open the lightbox where the donor can enter the amount they wish to donate.
