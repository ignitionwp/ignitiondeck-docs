## Order Data Export

The ID Commerce provides an Order Data Export that can be downloaded as a ZIP or CSV file containing the transactions made on the ID Commerce products. The products could be attached to a project’s reward levels or sold as a standalone product by the site.

Good to know

If the Address on Checkout has been turned on in Commerce » General » Checkout Settings, the supporter’s mailing address will be included as part of the export data.

### Data Export from the Admin

The data export is available for the site administrators with a paid IgnitionDeck license.

### Data Export for Project Creators

A data export is available to project creators via their dashboard with the IgnitionDeck Enterprise license.
