# Disabling the WordPress Toolbar

[](javascript:window.print())
In order to create a more unified customer experience, IgnitionDeck Commerce bypasses WordPress back-end admin and login screens, replacing them with similar front-end functionality.

However, once users login, they will still see the WordPress Toolbar, which unnecessarily provides access to the WordPress admin screen.

Fortunately, you can easily disable the WordPress Toolbar via IgnitionDeck Commerce’s General Settings menu. Simply check the box, save, and you’re done. The WordPress Toolbar will be completely removed from the front-end for non-administrator accounts.
