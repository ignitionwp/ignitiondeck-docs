# Handling Pre-Orders

[](javascript:window.print())
In addition to instant content delivery, ID Commerce can also take customer information for pre-orders and only charge once the product is ready for delivery. This integrates fully with IgnitionDeck crowdfunding projects that use the 100% threshold payment model.

Note that if you’re using IDE, IDC will automatically create pre-order products for creators submitting 100% threshold crowdfunding projects.

### *IgnitionDeck Enterprise

At the end of a creator's project, all pre-orders for all reward levels can be processed in one shot by using the Process Project Pre-Authorizations section.

Good to know

Once a pre-authorization has been processed and successfully captured, it cannot be captured again. This allows for projects to remain open after a project goal has been met and still continue to capture funds without charging the initial supporters again.
