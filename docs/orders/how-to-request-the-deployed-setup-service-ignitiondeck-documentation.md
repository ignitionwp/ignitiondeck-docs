### Here’s a full list of all of the details collected in this form:

1 Stripe does require the account holder to complete their profile, including providing identity documentation, applicable tax information, and banking, before live payments can be conducted on the site. This process can not be completed by IgnitionDeck and must be completed by the account holder. This can be done before or after the valet service is provided.

2 Funding options are dependent on the payment gateway(s) chosen, for more information on funding options please see our documentation.

3 Charging of crowdfunding fees are dependent on which payment gateway(s) are chosen and require that the gateway is enabled for creators.

After you’ve submitted the form, our team will test your login credentials to ensure that everything works as expected and follow up with any questions. Once all of the information has been confirmed, we'll schedule the service to begin. Deployed services are scheduled on a first come, first served basis and take 5 business days to complete, barring any issues we encounter. If we do encounter any issues, we will advise you immediately.

After we’ve completed the setup process, we’ll conduct a test payment to ensure that everything is working properly. Then we’ll reach out to let you know that the setup is complete and provide you with information on the next steps to take your site live.

That’s it! Now you have all the details needed to request the Deployed service with IgnitionDeck.

Still unsure about any part of this process? Please feel free to reach out to our support team with any questions you might have. We’d be happy to help!
