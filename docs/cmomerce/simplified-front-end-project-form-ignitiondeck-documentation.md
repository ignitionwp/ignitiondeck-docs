# Simplified Front-end Project Form

[](javascript:window.print())
The Simplified Front-end Project Form quickly converts the default project form into a simple donations-based fundraising platform. This customizes the front-end submission (FES) form by completely removing level-based options, leaving a single Pay What You Want /donation payment option in their place.

Heads up!

The Simplified Front-end Project Form option is not compatible with multiple reward levels and will convert any existing projects with multiple reward levels to the single donation-based model.
