I purchased a plugin / theme / module bundle from IgnitionDeck but I can’t find where to download it

Once you have purchased a theme, plugin, or extension from IgnitionDeck, it will be available for download via your IgnitionDeck Customer Dashboard at https://members.ignitiondeck.com.

The individual plugins (Core: IgnitionDeck, and Dependencies: ID Commerce and IgnitionDeck Crowdfunding) can all be downloaded from here, but only the IgnitionDeck plugin is required as the set up wizard will automatically install the other dependencies.
