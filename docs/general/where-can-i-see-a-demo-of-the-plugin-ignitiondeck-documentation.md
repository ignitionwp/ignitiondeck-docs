# Where can I see a demo of the plugin?

[](javascript:window.print())
You can take a tour of the admin side of a WordPress site with the IgnitionDeck plugins and our Multifondo theme here:

ðŸ’¥Launch the IgnitionDeck sandbox demo

## What will you see in the admin side sandbox?

Note: the admin sandbox is of the full IgnitionDeck functionality. Features will be missing in the free version.

## Theme demos

Theme demos are front end only demos that will allow you to see the possible styling of the crowdfunding site. The themes do not alter the functionality of the IgnitionDeck plugins seen within the IgnitionDeck admin sandbox/demo.
