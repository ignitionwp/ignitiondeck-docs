# Managing IgnitionDeck License Registration

[](javascript:window.print())
The IgnitionDeck license does allow for a localhost environment and/or a staging environment1 without having to manage the license registration. However, if you are not using a hosting provider that has a supported staging environment, you can change what site your license is activated on via the IgnitionDeck members dashboard.

Good to know

The IgnitionDeck Enterprise license allows for a single activation plus a supported staging/development environment. Managing where the license is registered may be required.

### Managing Your IgnitionDeck License

Please note that deactivating the license will not remove any of the configuration on your testing environment—it will simply disable the paid functionality.
